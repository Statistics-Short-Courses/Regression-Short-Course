# Checking model assumptions

## Assumptions of the linear model

### Independence of observations
### Linear relationship
### Constant Variance
### Normally distributed error


## Using residuals to check assumptions

## Common assumption violations
### Non-independence of observations
### Non-linear relationships
### Non-constant Variance
### Non-normality of error
