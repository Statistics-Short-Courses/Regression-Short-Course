# Preface {.unnumbered}

This notebook provides an introduction (or refresher) to **linear
regression**, a fundamental tool for modeling relationships between
variables. We'll explore the concepts, fit models in R, interpret
results, and visualize fits.

By the end, you should be able to:

-   Understand the linear regression model and its assumptions.

-   Fit and interpret simple and multiple regression models in R.

-   Diagnose model fit using residual plots and summary statistics.

-   Use model output to make predictions and assess uncertainty.
